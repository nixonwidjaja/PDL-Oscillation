# PDL-Oscillation

1. Install Spyder and OpenCV
Enter in Anaconda Prompt:
pip install opencv-python

2. Run Python program

3. The program will ask you to pick points for inspection line
Pick two points to form a line where the graphite will oscillate back and forth

4. The program will ask you to pick points for calibration line
Pick two points which you know the actual length between those points in real setup

5. Enter the actual length

6. Pick 1 point at half intensity approximately near the edge of graphite's oscillation 
(near the turnaround point)

7. You will obtain the oscillation graph, period, frequency, damping constant, and data exported 
in text file
